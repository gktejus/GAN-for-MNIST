# GAN-for-MNIST
A simple GAN for the MNIST dataset using Keras.

Simple and straightforward Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) implementations using the [Keras](https://keras.io/ "Keras") library.  
Several of the tricks from [ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) have already been implemented.

`GAN.py`: a standard GAN using fully connected layers.
